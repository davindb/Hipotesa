    "There are a lot of diseases that you need to detect at an early stage to be able to identify the treatment plan early on and help the patient secure a good way to live. An early detection of disease and a precise diagnosis allows for quicker action, saving precious time, and to prevent complications and rapid worsening. Health practitioners have conducted surveys and collected data on patient information, their disease, and symptoms that allow them to distinguish the patient's disease with common symptoms. Therefore, the dataset can be used to train the model that predicts the disease based on the symptoms."
