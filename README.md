<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Symptoms-Based-Disease-Prediction

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This is a Bangkit 2021 final project repository created by B21-CAP0170 team.

There are a lot of diseases that you need to detect at an early stage to be able to identify
the treatment plan early on and help the patient secure a good way to live. An early detection of
disease and a precise diagnosis allows for quicker action, saving precious time, and to prevent
complications and rapid worsening. Health practitioners have conducted surveys and collected
data on patient information, their disease, and symptoms that allow them to distinguish the
patient's disease with common symptoms. Therefore, the data set can be used to train the
model that predicts the disease based on the symptoms.

In this project we create an Android Native Mobile Application with the resources are supported by 
Google Cloud Platform and will involves user inputs which will be the data containing list of symptoms. 
And then, our system will perform a Machine Learning model that involves the data (list of symptoms). 
The final result is to generate the predicted disease following with its treatments.
